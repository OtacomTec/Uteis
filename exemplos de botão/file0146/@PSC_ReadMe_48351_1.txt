Title: XP Button (Remade)
Description: This XP button is a remake of my older version. This one includes the xp silver gradient colour, highlight effects, disable effects, hover effects, focus effects and acts the same way as a normal button. If you click the button but didn't mean to, you just drag your mouse off the button the same way you do for a normal command button. See screenshot for details
