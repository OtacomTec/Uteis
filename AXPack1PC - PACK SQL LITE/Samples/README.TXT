The samples are grouped by the environment in 
which they run or by the part of the AXPack1 they demonstrate.

This is not complete set of examples, more can be found online
and you can request some to be prepared on our fourm:
http://www.newobjects.net/forum

During the following months we are going to include the examples 
(at least the startup ones) in the NDL's help file, so that you
would be able to open them from the documentation without need
to go online or search the file system. 

Where to find more examples:
Online on AXPack1's home page http://www.newobjects.com/axpack1
In ALP, download the full package, examples are installed with a
catalog program that will help you find what you need. Note that
ALP uses AXPack1 as run-time library and thus its examples demonstrate
many of its features. The fact that ALP is probably different from
what you are going to use is not actually a problem, except the
way you create the objects and the user input/output techniques
everything else is pretty much the same regardless of the particular
environment. What you see in ALP's examples can be done in almost
any other with a little adaptation.
